# DS18B20
Simple PHP Code to automatically read and display DS18B20 names and temps to a php page on a raspberry pi.

####Instructions:
You will need to setup the pi to add OneWire support
Start by adding the following line to /boot/config.txt
You can edit that file with nano by running `sudo nano /boot/config.txt` and then scroll to the bottom and type

`dtoverlay=w1-gpio`

 press ctrl+x and y to confirm, then `sudo nano /etc/modules` add the following 2 lines to the bottom:

`w1-gpio`

`w1-therm`

press ctrl+x and y to confirm , then reboot your pi. Add temp.php to /var/www/ then visit http://127.0.0.1/temp.php

Page output should look similar to this:
```
Sensor ID#: 28-0214640d18ff = 26 째C / 79 째F 
Sensor ID#: 28-02146409b9ff = 25 째C / 77 째F
```
